# video-shot-agent (Penshot)

A multi-agent collaborative screenplay storyboarding system that splits scripts in various formats into script units optimized for AI text-to-video generation durations. It outputs high-quality storyboard fragment descriptions while ensuring narrative continuity. Built on LangChain and LangGraph, the system leverages LLMs to parse any script format into "Text-to-Video" prompt fragments compatible with mainstream AI video models. It supports task pool priority queuing, multi-level memory management, and Chroma vector retrieval.

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/storyboard' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
  "script": "Late at night, 11 PM in a city apartment living room. Heavy rain pours outside the window..."
}'
```

Check task status:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/status/{task_id}'
```

Retrieve task results:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/result/{task_id}'
```

## Integration Methods

### 1. Python SDK

```python
from penshot.api import create_penshot_agent

agent = create_penshot_agent(max_concurrent=5)

script = "Morning, a girl reading in a cafe, sunlight streaming through the window..."
task_id = agent.breakdown_script_async(
    script,
    callback=lambda r: print(f"Task {r.task_id} completed")
)

status = agent.get_task_status(task_id)
result = await agent.wait_for_result_async(task_id)
```

Full example: [direct_usage.py](https://github.com/neopen/video-shot-agent/blob/main/example/direct_usage.py)

### 2. FastAPI Web Application Integration

Integrate into existing systems via standard HTTP endpoints:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from penshot.api import create_penshot_agent

app = FastAPI(title="Penshot API", version="0.1.0")
agent = create_penshot_agent(max_concurrent=5)

@app.post("/api/generate")
async def generate(script_text: str):
    task_id = agent.breakdown_script_async(script_text)
    return {"task_id": task_id, "status": "PENDING"}
```

Full example: [web_app.py](https://github.com/neopen/video-shot-agent/blob/main/example/web_app.py)

### 3. LangGraph Node Integration

Can be embedded as an independent node in LangChain/LangGraph workflows for end-to-end automation. Full example: [langgraph_integration.py](https://github.com/neopen/video-shot-agent/blob/main/example/langgraph_integration.py)

### 4. A2A Protocol Collaboration

Supports context passing and task orchestration with upstream scriptwriting agents and downstream text-to-video/editing agents. Full example: [a2a_integration.py](https://github.com/neopen/video-shot-agent/blob/main/example/a2a_integration.py)

### 5. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support

```json
{
  "fragments": [
    {
      "fragment_id": "frag_001",
      "prompt": "Cinematic wide shot: midnight 11 PM in a compact urban apartment living room...",
      "negative_prompt": "cartoon, anime, 3D render, bright lighting, text, watermark...",
      "duration": 4.2,
      "model": "runway_gen2",
      "style": "cinematic 35mm film, moody realism, shallow depth of field...",
      "audio_prompt": {
        "audio_id": "audio_001",
        "prompt": "Low-frequency rain ambience (intensity 0.95), distant muffled TV static...",
        "model_type": "AudioLDM_3",
        "audio_style": "cinematic"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## System Notes & Considerations

| Category              | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Network Dependency    | Requires stable access to external LLM APIs. Proxy or domestic mirrors are recommended. |
| Long Text Processing  | For extremely long scripts, segmented input is advised. The system includes built-in context memory and RAG mechanisms. |
| Generation Duration   | AI video models may output clips with ±10% duration variance, which is industry-standard. |
| Multilingual Support  | Currently optimized for Chinese scripts. Support for other languages is under active iteration. |
| Audio Synchronization | Audio prompts are provided. Lip-sync and environmental sound fusion require downstream tooling. |
| Error Handling        | Auto-retry and fallback mechanisms are built-in. Extreme edge cases may require manual intervention. |

## Development Roadmap

### Short-Term

- Optimize long-shot segmentation logic for action continuity
- Implement consistency validators for character clothing, positioning, and props
- Specialized prompt format adaptation for Sora, Pika, and other models
- Hybrid architecture combining rule-based engines and LLMs
- Full English script support and intelligent node failure fallback
- Fragment confidence scoring and debug mode (intermediate result persistence)

### Mid-Term

- Advanced camera language support (pan, tilt, zoom, tracking, follow)
- Emotion-driven automatic visual style adjustment
- Ultra-long script chunking + vector DB context memory
- Multi-script batch queue processing & Web visualization interface
- Character/scene reference image integration & multi-format export (XML/EDL/JSON)

### Long-Term

- Multimodal input (image + audio + text hybrid)
- Real-time low-resolution preview & automatic continuity repair
- Professional editing software plugins (Premiere/FCP/DaVinci)
- Multi-user collaboration, version control, & autonomous learning from feedback
- Bidirectional script-fragment traceability, semantic alignment detection, & multi-round correction mechanisms

### Ultimate Goal

Achieve zero-information-loss visualization for scripts of any length, language, or genre, delivering a standardized workflow that meets professional director-level storyboarding standards. The system will feature customizable styles, full traceability, automatic optimization loops, and cross-modal high consistency.
